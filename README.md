#Pizza Orders API

The main goal of this project is to build an API for pizza orders, to test and train my API building skills.
This API has different endpoints for authentication with OAuth2 and JWT tokens, which generate a token for each user and a refresh token to renew the user's token after the first one expires.
This API also has endpoints for placing orders, canceling and finalizing orders, adding items to orders, and listing all orders and individual orders.
It's a simple API, but very useful for learning how to build the structure of an API and work with the FastAPI framework.
